<h1> PEROVSKITE </h1>
<h2 style="color:blue">more about peroskite</h2> 
<p>
perovskite is a yellow, brown and grayish black mineral consisting of an oxide of calcium, titanium A and sometimes containing rare earth elements, or a perovskite can also be any materials
with a crystal structure similar to the mineral called perovskite, which consist of titanium oxide
(CaTiO3), The mineral was first discovered in the Ural mountains of Russia by Gustav Rose in 1839 and named after Russian Mineralogist L . A Perovski (1792-1856), Helen Dick Mc Gas, published X-ray diffraction patterns of barium titanate that reveal its perovskite structure, 
The ideal perovskite structure is cubic (Fig. 12A), but natural perovskite shows a displacement of both Ca and O relative to Ti that reduces the symmetry to orthorthombic. This structure can be viewed as a network of titled Ti-O octahedral with the Ca situated between these octahedral (Fig. 12B). the degree of tilt or twist of the octahedral allows many other elements to be accommodated within this structure in both natural and synthetic perovskites. The   tilting has been described by angles a, b, y, to each of three orthogonal crystallographic axes, and the polarity with respect to the origin. CaTiO3 is accommodated by tilts in all three directions, with the tilt parallel to two axes having the same magnitude and polarity, whilst the tilt along the third axis differs in both magnitude and polarity.

<h1>PEROVSKITE MATERIALS</h1>
<p>
 Materials with the same types of crystal structure as that of CaTiO3 were know as perovskite materials. The general formula used to describe perovskite materials is ABX3, where A and B are cations with A larger than that of B and X is the anion usually halogens.  These structural  typically have a cubic or tetragonal cystal structure with the stoichoiometry of AMX3, wehre both A and M are metal cations and X is an anion (Fig. 3.1) Each cation M is octahedrally coordinated with the anions X to form the basic building block of the perovskite structure. These MX6 octahedra are connected in a three-dimensional corner-sharing configuration, with the cation a embedded in the space formed between adjacent MX6 octahedron to neutralize the charge of the structure.  Materials which have the same cyperoovskite Different classes of
perovskite materials, such as chalcogenide perovskite (ABO3), halide perovskite (ABX3) that is
again classified as alkali halide and organometal halide were widely studies. In the case of metal
halide perovskite, mainly cesium lead halide (CsPbX3) and methylammonium lead halide (CH3NH3PbX3) perovskite are the most popular ones. Halide perovskite structure was first observed in CsPbX3 in 1958. Studies on methyl ammonium based perovskite were started in the 1970s, and these materials attract huge attention due to their improved optical and electrical properties. perovskite material such as meth ammonium lead halides are cheap to produce and relatively simple to manufacture. perovskite  possess intrinsic properties like broad absorption spectrum, fast charge separation, long transport distance of electrons and holes, long carrier separation lifetime, and more, that make them very promising materials for solid- state solar cells Perovskite materials have emerged as the most promising and efficient low-cost energy materials for various optoelectronic and photonic device applications.
<h1>TYPES OF PEROVSKITE</h1>
Perovskite materials are classified based on the type of anion (O2− or X−). There is the
chalcogenide perovskite (ABO3) and the halide perovskite (ABX3). The halide perovskites are
further classified as alkali halide and organometallic halide (Verma et al., 2018)
<h1>1.2.1 Chalcogenide Perovskite</h1>

Chalcogenide perovskite can also be classified by cation valence, A+B5+O3 (1, 5); A2+B4+O3 (2,
4) and A3+B3+O3 (3, 3) and these alone covers a large range of compounds. Many interesting
electrical and magnetic properties can be found in the chalcogenide perovskite and these depend
chiefly on the character of the B cation. For example, the d electrons of the transition metals at
the B site have a marked effect creating a wide range of electrical behavior. Most chalcogenide
compound are semi-conductors, however, a few such as SrVO3 and SrRuO3 show metallic
conductivity and materials such as LaAlO3 and CaTiO3 have been shown to have ionic
conductivity (Kilner et al., 1991). Similarly, the range of magnetic properties are large; for
example, LaMnO3 is ferromagnetic whereas SrVO3 displays Pauli Paramagnetism (Kilner et al.,
1991). Some examples of chalcogenide halides include strontium titanate, calcium titanate, lead
titanate, bismuth ferrite, lanthanum ytterbium oxide etc. (Kilner et al., 1991). More are listed in
Table 1.1 below.
Chalcogenide halide perovskites can be deposited as epitaxial thin films on top of other
perovskites, using technique such as pulsed laser deposition and molecular-beam epitaxy.4

These films can be a couple of nanometers thick or as small as a single unit cells (Yang et al.,
2001). The well-defined and unique structures at the interfaces between the film and the
substrate can be used for interface engineering where new kind of properties can arise. This can
happen through several mechanisms, from mismatch strain between the substrate and film,
change in the oxygen octahedral rotation, compositional changes, and quantum confinement. An
example of this is LaAlO3 grown on SrTiO3, where the interface can exhibit conductivity, even
though both are non-conductive (Ohtomo and Hwang, 2004).
  
<h1>1.2.2 Organometallic Halide Perovskite</h1>

These are often referred to as organic–inorganic perovskites as it is hybrid. The organic cation A
usually methylammonium (CH3NH3+), ethylammonium (CH3CH2NH3+) and formamidinium
(NH2CHNH2+) are used. The cation B is commonly Pb and sometimes Sn is used because it
forms similar compounds with more ideal bandgap but exhibits lower stability due to the
oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in the iodide perovskite) (Aslam, et al., 2021)
Organometallic halide has a good opt electric properties for solar applications, for instance it is
characterized by a high dielectric constant a direct bandgap near the optimum value for the
highest conversion efficiency, a high absorption coefficient, high mobility and small effective
masses with the electron and hole mobility in the same range enchanting the bipolar conduction.
The best organometallic halide is CH3NH3Pb13. The inclusion of toxic Pb is also undesirable.
There are research efforts to substitute Pb or to mitigate it toxicity by tight encapsulation of the
solar cell and end of life recycling (Zekry et al., 2018)
<h1>1.2.3 Alkali Halide Perovskite</h1>
Recent research of doping halide perovskites with alkali metal ions Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+
has been acknowledge for polycrystalline and nanocrystalline thin films to maximize structural6
and optoelectronic properties i.e. to maximize luminance, facilitate charge injection, enhance
moisture resistance, and energy band alignment. To date cesium is the only alkali metal that can
substitute A-site cation in the ABX3 type perovskite due to it large ionic radii. The most common
alkali halide perovskite is CsPbI3 (Tabassum et al., 2021

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
Perovskite solar cell (PSC) discovered by Lev Perovski in the year 2009 as a new class in the third generation photovoltaic (PV) technology, evolved from dye sentisizer solar cells (DSSCs), that holds a major potential for future renewable energy The rapid improvement of perovskite solar cells has made them the rising star of the photovoltaics world and of huge interest to the academic community. Since their operational methods are still relatively new, there is great opportunity for further research into the basic physics and chemistry around perovskites. Furthermore, as has been shown over the past few years - the engineering improvements of perovskite formulations and fabrication routines has led to significant increases in power conversion efficiency, with recent devices reaching over 23%, as of June 2018.
